# Story Mode
The story mode is a 4-5 level gamemode where the story is driven through the dialogue boxes. Three of the levels are platformer based, whereas two of the levels are based on "survival" for a certain period of time, where the character must defend themselves from monsters that are chasing it, using laser blasters that can be shot by clicking. To progress through each level, the character must attain all coins and the level key. There are "checkpoints" which are represented by "black" flags which turn "white" once the checkpoint is activated. There are monsters which can be beaten by jumping on them, if the monster touches the character the level must be restarted.
